 # Amplifier with audio-car amp TDA7377

This repo contains no only desing files for this amplifier but also an easy design for a coupling board that allows use the IC in any protoboard, this is under _proto_ folder wich has the gerber and .nc files for fabrication.

The goal it's to create a complete audio device 2.0 with audio jack - bluetooth input the cheapest way.
Following that, all is minded to be throug hole components, also using less space possible and carving circuits with a simple CNC 3018.

At actual stage I got the basic functions (stereo input with audio Jack and bluetooth) but it's lacking the front board with leds and control, including switchs for power.
